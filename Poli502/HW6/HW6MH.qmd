\# Initialize variables to keep track of wins

\# Loop to simulate the Monty Hall game

\# Randomly assign the car behind one of the three doors (1, 2, or 3)

car_door \<- sample(1:3, 1)

\# The player randomly picks one door (1, 2, or 3)

player_choice \<- sample(1:3, 1)

\# Monty knows where the car is and opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.

\# Monty will open a door that is not the car door and not the player's initial choice.

available_doors \<- setdiff(1:3, c(player_choice, car_door))

monty_opens \<- sample(available_doors, 1)

\# If the player switches, their new choice is the remaining unopened door

switch_choice \<- setdiff(1:3, c(player_choice, monty_opens))\[1\] \# Ensure single value

\# Check if the player wins by switching or by staying

if (switch_choice == car_door) {

wins_if_switch \<- wins_if_switch + 1

}

\# Calculate probabilities of winning by switching or staying

probability_switch \<- wins_if_switch / num_simulations

probability_stay \<- wins_if_stay / num_simulations

\# Print the results
